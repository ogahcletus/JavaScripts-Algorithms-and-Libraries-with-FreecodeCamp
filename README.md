# JavaScripts-Algorithms-and-Libraries-with-FreecodeCamp
This is my working tutorial on JavaScript with freecodecamp  which is designed to make HTML and CSS   interactive. In this JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, I learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.  The objective is to enable me apply this knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.  Along the way, I also  also learnt two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP)
